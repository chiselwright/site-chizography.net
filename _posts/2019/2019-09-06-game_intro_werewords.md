> In Werewords, players guess a secret word by asking "yes" or "no" questions.

#### The Fluffy backstory

Look at the people around you and explain:

> The game is set in a strange village where almost everyone is a Villager.
> Some of you are playing the role of a pesky werewolf.

> One player will be the Mayor. They know a secret, magic word that will banish
> the werewolves from the village.

> Weirdly, the act of knowing the word has made the Mayor mute
> (and also unable to use pen &amp; paper it seems...)

> Werewolves also know the magic word; how else would they know what to be
> afraid of?

Pause. Let people ponder the fluffy backstory.


#### Winning And Losing

> So, how do you win?
> It depends what your role is in the game.

#### Villagers

> If you're a _Villager_ you win if the Villagers:
> * guess the word, and the Seer is *NOT* killed by a werewolf.
> * fail to guess the word, and the Villagers kill a werewolf.

> If you're a _Werewolf_ you win if:
> * the Villagers guess the word, but you manage to kill the Seer.
> * the Villagers fail to guess the word, and also fail to kill a werewolf.

Make sure people know to listen to the next piece of information.

> Your role is SECRET during each round. You are the only person who knows
> whether you are a Villager oe werewolf.

#### The General Gameplay

> A round will be timed.

> Once the timer has started all players may start asking Yes/No questions to
> the Mayor.

> Please try to let the Mayor answer one question before asking the next.

> If the Mayor is asked a question they MUST answer it, even if someone else
> already asked the question.
> (is someone not listening? maybe they're a werewolf wasting your precious
> Yes/No tokens...)

> If they Mayor runs out of Yes/No tokens the round ends immediately.

> THE MAYOR MUST NOT SPEAK.

#### End Of The Round

> If the word is guessed correctly, the werewolves have a chance to win by
> guessing who the Seer is.

> If the timer (or Yes/No tokens) runs out, the Villagers have a chance to
> win by killing a werewolf.

> Don't worry about remembering all of this - there's an app that will help
> run the game.

#### Roles

> Now that you've got an idea how the game plays, I should tell you about some
> of the roles.

> MAYOR: the person who is the Mayor gets the box of Yes/No tokens, as wll as
> these question-mark tokens which mean "maybe" or "I really don't know".

> VILLAGERS: nothing out of the ordinary here; Villagers are just regular
> players trying to guess the secret word

> WEREWOLVES: you'd think the fur would give them away, but things aren't
> quite that simple! Werewolves will also be asking questions, but they might
> be trying to lead the Villagers away from the secret word, or muddy waters
> with confusing answers ... generally just being unhelpful - but also making
> sure they aren't too obvious. They don't want to get themselves killed.

> SEER: It's not hopeless for the Villagers. They have a special person living
> amongst them. This person knows the secret word and might be able to guide
> the Villagers in the right direction. They don't want to make themselves too
> obvious though - killing the Seer is how the werewolves win!

Depending on player count, and selections in the app, you might need to
explain some of these:

> FORTUNE TELLER: the fortune teller is like a rubbish seer; for reasons we
> can't explain, they get to see part of the secret word.

> BEHOLDER: they know who the Seer is; this helps them know who to pay
> attention to when questions are being asked.

> THE THING: they wake up in the night and tap one of their neighbours on thie
> nearest shoulder. This gives you some information. It's up to you how much
> you say, and when. If you say anything at all!

Other Roles: If you do use other roles, look them up in the book and give
players the required information.

Most games play perfectly well with the roles described above.

You do not want to overload players with too many roles during their first
couple of plays.

#### The Mayor

> I need to tell you something else about the Mayor but it's slightly easier
> if we do the setup first.

## SETUP

Make sure you've installed [the app][app-link] and that your device is LOUD
ENOUGH or connected to an external speaker that's loud enough. Players will
need to hear instructions dictated by the app.

#### <i class="fas fa-mobile-alt"></i> [Get The App][app-link]

* make sure you select the correct game variant in the app (Werewords vs
  Werewords Deluxe, for example)
* give the Mayor more choice:
  * <i class="far fa-cog"></i> &gt; Other &gt; Mayor Choice
    * Increase the "Number of Words"
